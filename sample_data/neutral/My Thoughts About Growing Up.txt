I suppose, at the end of the day, I feel like the parents and teachers just get replaced with other figures. Like your influencers, clout-chasers and politicians. So previously if you were scared so speak up in class because you were afraid you would get suspended from school, or you were afraid to do something because you think your parents would discipline you, the same thing is true nowadays - just that the punishment is in the form of cancellation or imprisonment. I think at the end of the day - there is always a desire to become more powerful and to get your opinion heard and respected - and there will always exist a group of people who would be fundamentally opposed to you, regardless of where you would stand - even if where you would stand seems to be the most "moderate" opinion. There are some people who believe that the extreme opinion is moderate and your moderate position is extreme. Extreme and moderate are just labels we slap upon our own subjective normality.
