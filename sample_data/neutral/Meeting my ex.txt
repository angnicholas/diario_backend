I met my ex today. It was a pretty interesting experience. She wore a lot more jewellery and had manicured nails and also redid her hair, and looked quite different from how I remembered. We ate Korean food in Bugis. I think it was really nostalgic because being able to sort of re-live my past, going through the motions of walking alongisde a familiar figure through familiar streets just without the physical contact and without the emotional contractual obligation was an interesting experience. It feels great to finally be able to speak my mind without the emotional baggage. I think she also grew through the relationship - she seems less harsh on herself now and is beginning to explore new dimensions to her character and personality. I realised that since the breakup, I have also begun to change slowly, for instance, I try to talk in a more declarative manner by speaking more clearly and being more decisive.
