Today was a really dope day ok. I woke up at 6am cos my dad was going out to walk to tuas lamppost. Then I gymmed. Not a very hard session per se, recently I have been only doing about 1h of workout, because I wanna transition to a 5-day split - also so that I have more time to work per day. Anyway I went to eat bak chor mee. Honestly, it felt awesome to go back to the Tindrell project with my newfound knowledge of Django. The first time I tried my hand on Tindrell, I was really confused, but now it feels a lot smoother and I felt really good. I set up the postman, environment, everything in like half an hour, made some management commands to do DB operations, launched the frontend, even coded a script to help me parse the frontend response data. Honestly, i think i've become much better at coding. i can code a lot faster now in python. so i consider today a victory for myself. my boss texted me ask me do some manual editing on the server so i also did that. feeling blessed for today.
