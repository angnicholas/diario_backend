Anyway, after that Denise asked me how I make friends which was what led into the whole MBTI discussion. I told her that most of my friends just found me (I don't really make an effort to make friends, per se), but for better or for worse, a lot of my friends turn out to be INFPs so I suppose that's my innate criteria. She said she does both, like actively try to get to know people but also passively let people befriend her, but her main criteria for making friends is if they are not superficial (don't just chase popularity and prestige and money) but are actually capable of thinking deeply? And then she tried to guess my MBTI and she managed to guess it on the first try, apparently she felt that because I was okay with not having friends in army i must have been a T, because I prioritise exploration I must be a P (ok yeah that makes sense), I'm clearly an I, and N was just a wild guess because she couldn't really decide between N/S. So I was pretty impressed. Anyway after that we walked to a playground and sat down to chat for a bit more before going home.
