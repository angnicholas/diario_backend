Anyway, after that Denise asked me how I make friends which was what led into the whole MBTI discussion. I told her that most of my friends just found me (I don't really make an effort to make friends, per se), but for better or for worse, a lot of my friends turn out to be INFPs so I suppose that's my innate criteria. She said she does both, like actively try to get to know people but also passively let people befriend her, but her main criteria for making friends is if they are not superficial (don't just chase popularity and prestige and money) but are actually capable of thinking deeply?
