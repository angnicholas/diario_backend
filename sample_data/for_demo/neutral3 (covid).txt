Anyway, on Saturday, I felt fine in the morning. So I decided that I would take the day to go enjoy myself at a cafe and make some progress on my lab project. Initially I decided on the Sook Seng Bicycle Cafe near Seletar airport because it was really cool and I wanted to check it out but in the end I realised that the coffee shop which I planned to have lunch at that was near Seletar was closed. So I went to google search for nice cafes to work in and I found one called Botany which looked super nice and was beside Robertson Quay. So I went there to have my coffee and work. During my coffee I already got the sense of a slight sore throat which I felt was kinda weird because no matter how much water I drank I could not get it to go away. Usually I would get a minor itch if I drank coffee, but this one seemed quite persistent. I thought nothing much about it. Towards of the end of my session I got an email to do my pre-course readings for SNCS Level 2 so I went and did that before heading home. On the way home I walked by the river while taylor swift's "mine" was playing in my head because of the verse about sitting there by the water
