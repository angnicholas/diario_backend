Anyway, on Saturday, I felt fine in the morning. So I decided that I would take the day to go enjoy myself at a cafe and make some progress on my lab project. Initially I decided on the Sook Seng Bicycle Cafe near Seletar airport because it was really cool and I wanted to check it out but in the end I realised that the coffee shop which I planned to have lunch at that was near Seletar was closed. So I went to google search for nice cafes to work in and I found one called Botany which looked super nice and was beside Robertson Quay.
