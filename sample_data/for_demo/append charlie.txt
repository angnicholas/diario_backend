
It takes many years to get any noticeable increase in rank. I was talking to a purple belt guy and he said he trained for 5 years. And the typical number of years it takes to get a black belt is 10. So I suppose it's around 2-3 years per belt class which is honestly so long? But I mean it makes sense since there are so many different techniques, plus it probably takes a lot of time to perfect a single technique. I don't know if I would be able to continue training if I would be able to find a more affordable place after the trial, or if this week is going to be the end.
