This Saturday I am going to meet Denise, my primary school friend. Just now I was thinking about my primary school days (while someone like you was playing on my phone). It was so long ago. I remember doing my lab work with Pauline in NTU and felt like this was the most advanced work I've ever done in my life. I was learning how to do agar plating. I also remembered the P5 adventure camp, the Korea trip and all the times when everything around me seemed to be new and waiting ot be discovered.
