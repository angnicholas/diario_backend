This Saturday I am going to meet Denise, my primary school friend. Just now I was thinking about my primary school days (while someone like you was playing on my phone). Although I was a bit sad about it. I remember doing my lab work with Pauline in NTU and felt like this was the most advanced work I've ever done in my life.
