I have been training martial arts for the past 3 days. I have attended 2 BJJ lessons, 2 Muay Thai lessons and 1 Boxing lesson (with Anderson). The boxing instructor was the same as the Muay Thai instructor and honestly, a lot of the moves were similar (Probably because I haven't reached a high enough level for there to be much noticeable difference).
