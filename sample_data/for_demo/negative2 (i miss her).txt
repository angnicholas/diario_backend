I really miss her. I was going to work on my frontend but I gave up and went to browse the web when I saw a picture of the place where we had our first date and the memories all came flooding back. I can't help but wonder if there was something I could have done to save this, if it didn't have to end like this. At night when I lie in bed, it feels so cold and empty, and I miss her warmth. I know that it wasn't going to work out. But somewhere in the depths of my mind it still feels so real - when I see something funny in the day and get the urge to text her about it - that is when the realisation kicks in. You don't even understand what it feels like - to have everything suddenly reduced to nothing. Just completely zeroed out by a single statement. Obviously, it is ridiculous to base your entire self-worth on something like this. But I don't know if I will be able to wake up and go to the gym the next day after all this. I wonder if I really should bother trying anymore or I should really, really, really just give up.

Im sick and tired of trying anymore. What's the point of trying? Even if I minmax my life to the extreme and supercharge myself and break all the limits and barriers - I will never attain the happiness that I desire. I will never be able to live my dream life regardless of how much effort I put in. So what if I make a ton of money? All my skills, my knowledge, talent, everything, is for nothing if I can never achieve what I want.
