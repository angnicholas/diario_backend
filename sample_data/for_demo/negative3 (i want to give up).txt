You don't even understand what it feels like - to have what you imagined was your greatest achievement in life just reduced to nothing. Just completely zeroed out by a single statement. Obviously, it is ridiculous to base your entire self-worth on the opinions of two of your friends. If you can get destroyed - if your purpose of living can be erased just by two utterances, then is it true? I thought about whether or not I would be able to wake up and go to the gym the next day after all this. I wonder if I really should bother trying anymore or I should really, really, really just give up.
