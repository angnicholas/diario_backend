I want to really see how far I can go this time. I have fallen again and again but I have not given up and I will not back down. Half the year is over. Bad honestly. But it's ok. It's alright. For you, for you, although you're not mine, although you'll never be mine, although I don't want you to be mine, but for you, I will strive and I will achieve. That is the way in which I psych myself up to do anything that's difficult but that's important for me. Rather than wasting time on youtube - I will strive to make you proud and lessen your suffering.
