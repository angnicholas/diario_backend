Im sick and tired of trying anymore. Was it worth it honestly? I spent close to a 150 bucks on a night where I spent the last 3 hours just wallowing in self-pity and trying my best not to cry. That feeling of absolute man, I don't care anymore. I was walking around the food court pushing chairs back because I went, what's the point of life, I might as well give myself a false sense of purpose. I was walking around the club thinking - I am going to amass all these technical skills and knowledge so much more than these other people around yet I would never be able to share in their happiness. Even if I minmax my life to the extreme and supercharge myself and break all the limits and barriers - I will never attain the happiness that I desire. I will never be able to live my dream life regardless of how much effort I put in, I told myself. And then at that point it made sense that all my money was kinda worthless. All my skills, my knowledge, talent, everything, was for nothing if I could never achieve what I want.
