I really miss her. I was going to work on my frontend but I gave up and went to browse the web when I saw a picture of the place where we had our first date and the memories all came flooding back. I can't help but wonder if there was something I could have done to save this, if it didn't have to end like this. At night when I lie in bed, it feels so cold and empty, and I miss her warmth. I know that it wasn't going to work out. But somewhere in the depths of my mind it still feels so real - when I see something funny in the day and get the urge to text her about it - that is when the realisation kicks in. I thought that I would be over this a lot faster, but I suppose, life is always full of surprises huh? I guess I just don't deserve love. Maybe I'll never find a girlfriend as good as her ever again.
