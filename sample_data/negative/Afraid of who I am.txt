I'll tell myself I wasn't cut out for this. I might not even enjoy my winter skiing trip because of these thoughts. All my friends are going to go away, Justin, Timothy and Alexander. I barely talk to them anymore. Alexander is visiting his friends and touring around. I'm going to book a flight to Germany to meet Pauline and her boyfriend for a day. I'll probably also stay over in Berlin for a night, and the next day I'll just walk around the city aimlessly, but everyone is taller than me and I'll be so scared that I am breaking some custom and I can't concentrate on anything and when I meet Pauline I am so scared and awkward and she points that out and I stutter and I get conscious for stuttering and conscious about my Singaporean accent and her boyfriend is more nicely dressed than me and I wonder - what does he know that I don't, and all those intrusive thoughts come rushing back. I can see it all now, in perfect colour. It is so unlike what I had imagined from the start. I am scared to go to the gym because everyone there is so much bigger sized than me. Someone comes up to me and asks if I can share the machine and I cut my sets short to accomodate him. And I feel bad for doing that. Because then I am stuck to the dumbbells! Sighs. I don't know man. When will I ever be successful? When will I ever be good enough?
